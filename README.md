Northern Ontario Hospital Website Redesign


### Asia Levesque Gault
Feature1: FAQ/
Feature2: Volunteer/

The Purpose of the FAQ feature is to Allow the websites visitors to see freequently asked questions. These Question's CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are controled by the website's Administrators. They will be able to login with Administrator credentials and have their own CMS(Content Management System) to easily add an FAQ, Publish an FAQ, Edit an FAQ and delete an FAQ. Vistitors who are not Administrators will be able to view all FAQs and view the Details of an FAQ.

As of 8:48pm MST I have completed the List, Delete and Detail aspects of the FAQ feature. At this point I am very proud of what I have accomplished. This is already furthur than I had gotten with the Passion Project and The only help I needed was fixed by Prof. Bittle, it was "The Remote Certificate is Invalid". Since then I debugged many issues and I took each on at a time and in small steps. One bugg I got stuck on was I created a viewmodel but forgot to run a migration. I commented everything out deleted the view model. started over and it worked perfectly. All this debugging really has made me understand this a lot more than previous projects. Frankly Debugging was initially frustrating but once you see the # of errors decrease it was fun. This turned into a puddle or a waterslide to see how information flows and talks. I am excited to keep working on this.
