Northern Ontario Hospital Website Redesign<br/>
Gift Shop Feature By: Rohit Badyal
Two tables I have done was a Products table and a Orders Table 
For the Products table, someone can Do CRUD are the Products table and these products are for the gift shop
For the Order Table, CRUD can also be done on the orders table, some one can create an order with order name and order message and then edit the order
While editing the order, thats where they can add whatever products they want.
